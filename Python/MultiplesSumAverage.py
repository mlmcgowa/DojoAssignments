# Multiples
# Part 1
# print odd num 1 to 1000, with loop and no list

# for i in range(1001):
#     if i % 2 != 0:
#         print i

# Part 2
# print all num 5 to 1,000,000, by multiples of 5

# for i in range(1000001):
#     if i % 5 == 0:
#         print i

# Sum List
# print the sum of the values in the list a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]

# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# print sum(a)

# Average List
# print the average of the values in the list a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]

a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
average = sum(a) / len(a)
print average
